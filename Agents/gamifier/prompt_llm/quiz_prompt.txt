# EXAMPLE OUTPUT

<question>
<text>Given your vegetarian diet and 20-week pregnancy, which combination provides the best iron absorption?</text>
<options>
<A>Spinach salad with orange slices</A>
<B>Iron supplement with coffee</B>
<C>Beans with dairy yogurt</C>
<D>Fortified cereal with tea</D>
</options>
<answer>A</answer>
