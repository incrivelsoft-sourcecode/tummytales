PREGNANCY MEAL TYPE GUIDELINES

BREAKFAST
A nutritious breakfast provides energy for the day and helps stabilize blood sugar. Include protein, complex carbohydrates, and fruits or vegetables. Examples include whole grain toast with nut butter and fruit, vegetable omelets with whole grain toast, or yogurt with fruit and nuts.

LUNCH
Midday meals should sustain energy through the afternoon. Include lean protein, complex carbohydrates, and vegetables. Examples include grain bowls with beans and roasted vegetables, sandwiches on whole grain bread with lean protein and vegetables, or hearty salads with protein.

DINNER
Evening meals should be satisfying but not too heavy. Include lean protein, vegetables, and a moderate portion of complex carbohydrates. Examples include baked fish with roasted vegetables and quinoa, stir-fries with brown rice, or bean-based chili with a side salad.

SNACKS
Snacks help maintain stable blood sugar and prevent excessive hunger. Include protein or healthy fat with carbohydrates for sustained energy. Examples include fruit with nut butter, yogurt with berries, hummus with vegetables, or a small handful of nuts with dried fruit.

DESSERTS
Occasional treats can be part of a balanced diet. Healthier options include fresh fruit with a small amount of dark chocolate, yogurt parfaits with fruit and granola, or baked apples with cinnamon. Limit added sugars and portion sizes.

BEVERAGES
Stay hydrated with water, herbal teas, and limited amounts of fruit juice. Limit caffeine to 200mg daily (about one 12oz cup of coffee). Avoid alcohol completely. Milk and fortified plant milks provide calcium and vitamin D.
