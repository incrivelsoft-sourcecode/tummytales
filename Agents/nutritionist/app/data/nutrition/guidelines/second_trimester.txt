SECOND TRIMESTER NUTRITIONAL NEEDS

The second trimester is a period of rapid growth. Baby's muscles, bones, and organs are developing, and maternal blood volume continues to expand.

CALORIC NEEDS
Energy requirements increase by approximately 340 calories per day. Focus on nutrient-dense foods rather than empty calories.

IRON
Continue with 27 mg daily intake. Iron deficiency can lead to maternal anemia and complications. Sources include lean red meat, spinach, beans, and fortified cereals.

CALCIUM
Maintain 1,000 mg daily intake. The baby's bones are now calcifying rapidly, and inadequate maternal calcium can lead to bone loss. Sources include dairy products, fortified plant milks, and leafy greens.

OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS
Critical for baby's brain and eye development. Aim for 2-3 servings of low-mercury fish weekly or consider plant sources like flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts.

VITAMIN D
Works with calcium for bone development. Aim for 600 IU daily. Sources include sunlight exposure, fatty fish, fortified dairy, and egg yolks.

FIBER
Helps prevent constipation, which is common during this trimester. Aim for 25-30g daily through fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.

HYDRATION
Increased blood volume requires adequate hydration. Aim for 8-10 cups (64-80 oz) of fluids daily, primarily from water.

MANAGING HEARTBURN
Small, frequent meals can help prevent heartburn. Avoid spicy, fatty, and acidic foods if they trigger symptoms. Stay upright after eating.

FOODS TO CONTINUE AVOIDING
- Raw or undercooked animal products
- High-mercury fish
- Unpasteurized dairy
- Excessive caffeine
- Alcohol
