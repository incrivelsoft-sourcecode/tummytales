FIRST TRIMESTER NUTRITIONAL NEEDS

The first trimester is crucial for embryonic development. During this period, the neural tube forms and major organs begin to develop. While caloric needs don't increase significantly, nutrient quality is essential.

FOLATE/FOLIC ACID
Aim for 600-800 mcg daily. This B vitamin is critical for preventing neural tube defects like spina bifida. Sources include dark leafy greens, fortified cereals, beans, and citrus fruits.

IRON
Iron requirements increase to support the expanding blood volume. Aim for 27 mg daily. Good sources include lean red meat, poultry, fish, legumes, tofu, and fortified cereals. Pair with vitamin C-rich foods to enhance absorption.

CALCIUM
Required for developing bones and teeth. Target 1,000 mg daily. Sources include dairy products, fortified plant milks, tofu, and dark leafy greens.

PROTEIN
Essential for tissue growth and baby's development. Aim for 75-100g daily. Sources include lean meats, poultry, fish, legumes, tofu, eggs, and dairy products.

MORNING SICKNESS MANAGEMENT
Small, frequent meals can help manage nausea. Cold foods may be better tolerated than hot foods with strong smells. Keep crackers by the bedside to eat before getting up. Ginger and vitamin B6 may help reduce nausea.

- High-mercury fish (shark, swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish)
