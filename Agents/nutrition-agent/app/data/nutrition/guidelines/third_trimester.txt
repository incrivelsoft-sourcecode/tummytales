THIRD TRIMESTER NUTRITIONAL NEEDS

The third trimester sees continued fetal growth and development. The baby is gaining weight rapidly, and maternal tissues are preparing for birth and lactation.

CALORIC NEEDS
Energy requirements increase by approximately 450 calories per day. Quality nutrition remains important as the baby builds fat stores.

PROTEIN
Protein needs remain high at 75-100g daily. Adequate protein supports the baby's growth and prepares maternal tissues for lactation.

IRON
Maintain 27 mg daily intake. Iron stores now will help prevent postpartum anemia. Good sources include red meat, poultry, fish, beans, and fortified cereals.

CALCIUM
Maintain 1,000 mg daily intake. The baby's bones continue to strengthen, drawing on maternal calcium stores if dietary intake is inadequate.

VITAMIN K
Important for blood clotting in both mother and baby. Sources include dark leafy greens, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts.

MANAGING DIGESTIVE DISCOMFORT
Smaller, more frequent meals can help manage heartburn and the pressure of the growing uterus on the digestive system.

PREPARE FOR LACTATION
Nutritional stores now will support early milk production. Ensure adequate intake of calcium, vitamin D, protein, and healthy fats.

BLOOD SUGAR MANAGEMENT
Some women develop gestational diabetes in the third trimester. Regular meals and snacks with balanced carbohydrates, proteins, and fats help manage blood sugar levels.

HYDRATION
Adequate fluid intake helps prevent urinary tract infections, constipation, and preterm labor. Aim for 8-10 cups (64-80 oz) daily.

FOODS TO CONTINUE AVOIDING
